## Project Idea & Wireframes:

Our website will have many pages and a navigation bar to access those pages.

The home page will have: 1) who we are       2) our project idea & inspiration     3)How to access our github/ guide

Home page example:

* We could have a "diagram" of tables, but this would be hard to accomodate for if we want to expand to different classrooms which may have different class setups.
* Note, the seating chart will also have features to 

## Success Idea (What a successful project looks like)
